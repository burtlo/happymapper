UnhappyMapper
=============

UnHappymapper was a grandchild (a fork of a fork) of the great work done first by [jnunemaker](https://github.com/jnunemaker/happymapper) and then by [dam5s](http://github.com/dam5s/happymapper/).

The reason I created the gem is because I had a need to create it in the absence of [dam5s](http://github.com/dam5s/happymapper/). Since then I have been added to that project and work continues there.
